Project description:
The goal of this game is simply to last for as long as possible without your resources draining or you dying from collisions.  You gain resources from mining rocks of a certain color.  There are also some sentient rocks that will give you all three resources, but they avoid you.  There is no way to regain health.

Standard movement of WASD and toggling the HUD is F1.  There are sounds, so use headphones!  to activate god mode, press g.

Extra Contribution: I drew my own sprites.

Problems with this project:
Sometimes the bullets get skewed.  There might be an issue where a rock doesn't explode even when you shoot it.  Also sound does not play if you explode from taking too much damage.
